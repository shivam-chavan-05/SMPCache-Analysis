## SMP Cache Projects â€“ Computer System Architecture
Welcome to the repository for SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) Cache Simulation Projects, created as part of my Computer System Architecture coursework. This repo contains two independent projects that explore multi-core cache design, coherence protocols, and memory consistency in shared-memory systems.

### ðŸ“š Course: Computer System Architecture
### ðŸ›  Topics Covered: SMP architecture, cache coherence, MESI protocol, memory access patterns
